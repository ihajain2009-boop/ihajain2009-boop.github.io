        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          InTeen is a non-profit organisation dedicated to providing meaningful internship opportunities to high school students across India. In a country where academic achievement often dominates focus, real-world exposure can be rare. We bridge that gap by connecting motivated teens with companies and startups ready to mentor and include them — creating pathways for practical learning, confidence, and career clarity.

        <h2>Note From the Founders</h2>
        <div class="founder-note">
          <p>
            When we started InTeen, we knew exactly what it felt like to be high-school students searching for real opportunities. As teens ourselves,
            we understand the frustration of wanting to learn, grow, and gain experience — but having nowhere to start. This platform was created so students
            like us could finally have a place to explore careers, take initiative, and discover what they’re truly capable of.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope InTeen becomes the first step in your journey — the one that opens doors, builds confidence, and shapes your future in ways that classrooms
            alone cannot.
          </p>
